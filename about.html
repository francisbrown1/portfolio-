            <p>Hi, I'm francis. I'm a multi-
                talented human with over 10+
                years of experiences in wide
                range of design disciplines.
                francis.
                You can also call me a product designer,
                experience designer, interaction, UI, UX
                or by any other market defined function-
                title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker
                with over 10 years of experiences in wide
                range of design disciplines, manager,
                advisor, entrepreneur, front-end
                developer, music enthusiast, traveler,
                photographer and more.
                I don't like to define myself by the work
                I've done. I define myself by the work I
                want to do. Skills can be taught,
                personality is inherent. I prefer to keep
                learning, continue challenging myself,
                and do interesting things that matter.
                Fueled by hiah eneray levels and Fueled by high energy levels and
                boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired
                and more then willing to follow my
                fascinations wherever they take me. I'm
                passionate, expressive, multi-talented
                spirit with a natural ability to entertain and
                inspire. I'm never satisfied to just come up
                with ideas. InsteadI have an almost
                impulsive need to act on them.
                My abundant energy fuels me in the
                pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas
                of study and artistic endeavors. I'm a fast
                learner, able to pick up new skills and
                juggle different projects and roles with
                relative ease.
                I like to develop expertise in a number of
                areas over the course of my life and
                career. My personality type is EN. I
                currently work remotely with a selected
                freelance client base and are open for new opportunities</p>
